# Self-Projects: A collection of projects I have done on my own to expand my skills. 
# 1. Independent Tableau Dashboard Project
A self-directed data visualization project completed to challenge my technical skills and gain hands-on experience with Tableau outside of formal coursework. This project demonstrates my ability to learn new tools independently, apply best practices in data visualization, and communicate insights through interactive dashboards. I used a structured YouTube tutorial as a learning reference while independently building and refining the final dashboard, making my own decisions around layout, filtering, and storytelling.
